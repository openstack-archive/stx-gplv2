The upstream mariadb includes TokuDB source code with AGPL license.
As AGPL-3.0 is considered a prohibited license by WR, we've modified
the source tarball to delete the storage/tokudb directory and remove
the AGPL reference from the EXCEPTIONS-CLIENT Foss License file. The
spec file has also been modified to compile without tokudb support.
