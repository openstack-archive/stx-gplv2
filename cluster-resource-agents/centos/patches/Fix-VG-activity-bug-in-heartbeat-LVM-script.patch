Subject: [PATCH] Fix VG activity bug in heartbeat/LVM script

There is currently an issue in the lvm2 package where if you create an LVM thin
pool, then create a thin volume in the pool, then the udev rule doesn't think
there should be a /dev// symlink for the thin pool, but "vgmknodes" and
"vgscan --mknodes" both think that there should be such a symlink. This is a
bug, but it's in the field in CentOS 7 at least and likely elsewhere.

The end result of this is that on such a system running either "vgscan
--mknodes" or "vgmknodes" and then running "vgchange -an " will
leave the /dev/ directory with a dangling symlink in it.

This breaks the LVM_status() function in this OCF script, since the
/dev/ directory exists and is not empty even though the volume
group is not active.

This commit changes the code to directly query lvm about the volume group
activity rather than relying on side effects.
